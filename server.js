/* --- First endpoint ---
Endpoint that returns whole books array http://localhost:8081/books

or different data depending on the query string parameter e.g. author, title, language, average rating and page. 

Example routes for author, title, language and average rating:
http://localhost:8081/books?author=rowling
http://localhost:8081/books?title=harry
http://localhost:8081/books?language=eng
eng, en-GB, en-US, spa, fre, ger, ara, por, grc, mul
http://localhost:8081/books?averagerating=4

For the the page query a list of 50 results will be returned from the books array that have been pre-sliced using the slice method. 
What data is returned depends on what number the user has queried in the endpoint e.g. http://localhost:8081/books?page=1. 
The number specified is stored in the page query variable and will have a 1 subtracted from it and * by 50 to create the initial index number to be used in the slice. This is stored in the startIndex variable and then used in slice to initiate which book should be returned at the beginning of the slice and which should be return at the end, although the end element will be omitted as this is a side effect of the slice method. This will then return 50 books depending upon which page number is written. If the user types a page number that doesn't exist then an empty array is returned.

/* ---- Second endpoint ----
Getting a specific book based on the id added to the endpoint. 
:id is a variable that will be the value the user has specified on the endpoint e.g. 3. Use params to get the id/value the user has specified in endpoint and put that into the bookId variable. We then use that when finding the id in the array by comparing the bookID number in the array with the id the user has specified on the endpoint. 
If statement for if the length of the specificBook variable/array is 0 (i.e. the author doesn't exist) then return the error message, else translate the bookID element from the array into json so the data it's readable on the endpoint.*/
