/* ---- Second endpoint ----
Getting a specific book based on the id added to the endpoint. 
:id is a variable that will be the value the user has specified on the endpoint e.g. 3. Use params to get the id/value the user has specified in endpoint and put that into the bookId variable. We then use that when finding the id in the array by comparing the bookID number in the array with the id the user has specified on the endpoint. 
If statement for if the length of the specificBook variable/array is 0 (i.e. the author doesn't exist) then return the error message, else translate the bookID element from the array into json so the data it's readable on the endpoint.*/
